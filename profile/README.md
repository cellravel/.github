# CellRavel (*Unraveling the Secrets of Cells*)

CellRavel is an emerging community-driven initiative focused on advancing education and research in bioinformatics, AI, cancer research, and immunotherapy. At this stage, we are an informal initiative, operating entirely on a volunteer basis without generating any income. Our mission is to provide free, high-quality educational resources and promote collaborative research for the global scientific community.

## 🌱 What's Coming Up?

We are in the early stages of developing educational content and potentially research initiatives for the open source community. Our focus will be on providing high-quality educational resources and eventually launching collaborative research projects. We are currently planning for:

- **Education**: Producing free comprehensive educational resources on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cellravel) for those interested in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, AI, Cancer Research, and Immunotherapy; from beginners to advanced practitioners!
  - Checkout our first project: [PATOG](https://github.com/CellRavel/patog) (Curated Collection of Resources to learn Bioinformatics, Data Science, ML, etc.)

- **Research & Developement**: Developing cutting-edge tools in R and Python for the analysis of biological data. Our research will be particularly focused on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance cancer diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. By combining machine learning techniques with advanced bioinformatics, we aim to revolutionize how the immune system can be harnessed in the fight against cancer.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute or collaborate with us once we prepare to kick off our projects in the near future!
